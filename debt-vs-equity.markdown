For many businesses, credit solutions have become critical to achieving their key strategic and financial objectives, including:
- Accelerating growth trajectory
- Extending runway to the “next milestone,” such as a liquidity event or reaching cash flow breakeven
- Managing working capital 
- Providing a “safety net” without dilution
- Enabling acquisitions
- Delivering shareholder liquidity
