**Tough Mudder** is an endurance event series in which participants attempt obstacle courses that tests mental as well as physical strength. It was co-founded by Will Dean, a former British counter terrorism officer, and Guy Livingstone, a former corporate lawyer. The main principle of the Tough Mudder revolves around teamwork.
